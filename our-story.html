						<p>
							My friends and I decided to go to Gallette's one Wednesday night in Tuscaloosa.
							Over the course of the next few hours I kept making eye contact with this pretty girl.
							I of course couldn't work up the courage to go talk to her.
							Fortunately for me, she came up and introduced herself right as the bar was closing and everyone was shuffling out.
							I almost let her go, but came to my senses and ran after her and asked for her number.
							We started talking the next day and that was pretty much it.
							Our first date was at Desperado's Steakhouse and it was very apparent that we had a lot in common.
							I asked her to be my date for my fraternity's formal in New Orleans. On that trip I think we both realized we were meant for each other.

							It was a Wednesday, and my friend Jill and I were at Gallettes for Wine Wednesday.
							We had been there for a little while when I made eye contact with a rather tall fella from across the bar.
							He looked familiar, but I couldn’t quite place him.
							For the next two hours, we kept catching each other’s eye, and it became clear that he was not going to introduce himself.
							So when the lights came on and the bar began to shut down, I walked right up to him and asked his name.
							He said, “Uhh Chris,” and suddenly Jill grabbed my hand and whisked me out the door.
							She thought he was a creeper who was bothering me.
							Chris sprinted out the door to catch up with us and put his phone in my hand asking for my number.
							He texted me the next day, and the rest is history.

					<h2>His Perspective</h2>

						<p>
							It took me forever to work up the courage to buy her ring.
							We had gone several months back and I already knew what I wanted to get her but I was just being a chicken.
							It took me almost as long to plan how I wanted to propose.
							We had recently put in an offer on a house and were in the process of packing up boxes in our apartment (well, she was; I was procrastinating.)
							I found little mementos from significant points in our relationship: when we met, our first trip together, our first date, when I asked her to be
							my girlfriend, our first apartment, and, finally, our future. I wrote a letter for each one and I left that one blank.
							The day of I was incredibly nervous. I could barely concentrate on anything at work.
							I called her as I was leaving work and told her to make sure she was home in time to make our dinner reservations. This was, of course, the first
							she had heard of this. I knew this would make her suspicious but I didn't want this to be a total surprise when she got back.
							She went to get her nails done (I knew she would do this if there was even the slightest hint that I might be proposing) and I went home to get everything
							ready and wait.
							The wait was excruciating. I watched Netflix while looking through the blinds every 5 minutes or so to see if she was back.
							When she finally came home, I was pouring sweat on the couch and probably looked like a nervous wreck.
							I told her that I had finally packed a box, and went over to her as she opened it. She knew exactly what was happening as soon as she opened the first box.
							She finally got to the last one and found the ring box. I opened it (upside down, at first) and got down on one knee and asked her to marry me.
							Afterwards, my mom and sister came over to congratulate us, then the two of us celebrated with a dinner at our favorite restaurant in Birmingham, Ocean.
							As it turns out one of my old friends I hadn't seen since high school was a waiter there and saw me. He told the restaurant we had just gotten engaged
							so they brought us champagne and a signed card from all the staff. It was the perfect end to a perfect evening.

							Again, it was a Wednesday.
							I knew Chris was going to proposing eventually, so I had been trying to keep my nails looking good.
							It was a rough day, so I mentioned to my friend/coworker Kathryn that I was going to splurge and get a pedicure too.
							Little did I know, Chris had gotten Kathryn to keep up with my plans.
							She immediately let him know that my appointment would run longer which could make us late for the secret dinner reservations he had made.
							At around 4pm, Chris called me, asked what my plans were for the night, and told me to make sure I was home for our 7:00 dinner reservations.
							I instantly knew what was up but tried to play it cool on the phone.
							After hanging up with him, I ran to Kathryn’s cube freaking out.
							She acted super surprised while I retold our phone conversation.
							After getting my nails done, I came home to find Chris nervously sitting on my side of the couch.
							He was sweating.
							I sat down next to him, and he told me he had finally packed a box. (We were planning a move, and he had not packed a single box).
							He picks up the box to show me.
							The box was filled with smaller boxes.
							Each box contained a letter and a memento from a special time in our lives: a Gallettes cup (first met) , The Eagles Desperado album (first date), our first picture together (first trip), lady fingers (came with dessert when he asked me to be his girlfriend), and the key to our first apartment.
							When the last box came up, I sped read through the letter.
							Chris got down on one knee and opened the ring box upside down.
							We had a good laugh, then finally popped the question.
							It was one of the best nights!
